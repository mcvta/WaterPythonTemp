# WaterPythonTemp


This repository includes the python code of four models that were used to predict the water temperature of 83 rivers with limiting forcing data (with 98% of missing data):
i)	Artificial Neural Network (Momentum algorithm);
ii)	 Random Forest;
iii)	Support Vector Regression
iv)	Multiple Regression. 

The results of this study are described in the following manuscript: 
Almeida, MC and Coelho PS.: Modeling river water temperature with limiting forcing data.
The machine learning models hyperparameter optimization was implemented with the Tree-structured Parzen Estimators algorithm (TPE). The python code implementation of TPE with the Hyperot algorithm is also available.
